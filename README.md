# TreeCoverClassifiers
This repository contains the source code for a machine learning tree cover classification project. This project was the final project for CSS 581 Machine Learning at the University of Washington, Bothell, in Spring 2017. 

The results from this project were published as a paper entitled "Machine Learning Classification of Tree Cover Type and Application to Forest Management" in the International Journal of Multimedia Data Engineering and Management (IJMDEM), Volume 9, Issue 1.

This project's code is written in MATLAB, so you must have access to that software and its neural network toolbox to run this code. The main program is the treeCoverClassifiers file, with the other functions each living in their own files.
